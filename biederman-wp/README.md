# Biederman WordPress Theme

## Install
1. Upload the `biederman` folder into `wp-content/themes/` (or upload the ZIP via WP Admin → Appearance → Themes → Add New → Upload Theme).
2. Activate **Biederman**.
3. Set the homepage:
   - Settings → Reading → **Your homepage displays** → **A static page**
   - Select any page as **Homepage** (the theme uses `front-page.php`).

## Customize content
Appearance → Customize:
- **Biederman: Band** (tagline + intro)
- **Biederman: Next Show** (for the show box + ICS download data)
- **Biederman: Links** (booking email + socials)

## Menus
Appearance → Menus:
- Assign a menu to **Primary Menu**.
- If no menu is assigned, the theme falls back to section links (#shows, #media, …).

## Notes
- Newsletter form is frontend-only (demo). Connect it to your ESP (MailerLite/Mailchimp/Brevo) via a plugin or embed.
- Replace placeholders in the Media section with real embeds.
